# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a LINE Mini App built with Next.js and deployed to Vercel that serves as a testing platform for JavaScript standard APIs. The application will help developers understand how various JavaScript APIs behave within the LINE Mini App environment by providing dedicated test pages for each API or functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access a LINE Mini App that tests JavaScript APIs, so that I can understand which standard JavaScript features work in the LINE Mini App environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the LINE Mini App THEN the system SHALL display a main page with a list of available JavaScript API tests
2. WHEN a user selects an API test THEN the system SHALL navigate to a dedicated page for that specific API
3. WHEN the app is accessed through LINE THEN the system SHALL function properly within the LINE Mini App webview environment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each JavaScript API to have its own dedicated test page, so that I can focus on testing specific functionality without interference from other APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is designed THEN each JavaScript API or feature SHALL have its own unique URL/page
2. WHEN a user navigates to an API test page THEN the system SHALL display clear information about what API is being tested
3. WHEN a user is on an API test page THEN the system SHALL provide interactive elements to trigger and test the API functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the actual behavior and results of JavaScript API calls, so that I can understand how they work in the LINE Mini App environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user triggers an API test THEN the system SHALL execute the JavaScript API call
2. WHEN an API call is executed THEN the system SHALL display the results, including success/failure status and any returned data
3. WHEN an API call fails THEN the system SHALL display error information and error messages
4. WHEN an API call succeeds THEN the system SHALL display the successful result data in a readable format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the app to be deployed on Vercel, so that it's easily accessible and maintainable with modern deployment practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL be compatible with Vercel's deployment requirements
2. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible via a Vercel-provided URL
3. WHEN changes are made to the codebase THEN the system SHALL support automatic deployment through Vercel's CI/CD pipeline

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the app to be built with Next.js, so that I can leverage modern React features and server-side rendering capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is developed THEN it SHALL use Next.js as the primary framework
2. WHEN pages are loaded THEN the system SHALL utilize Next.js routing for navigation between API test pages
3. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL leverage Next.js optimization features for performance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test common JavaScript APIs, so that I can verify their compatibility in the LINE Mini App environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system includes API tests THEN it SHALL include tests for common JavaScript APIs such as localStorage, sessionStorage, geolocation, camera access, and fetch
2. WHEN the system includes API tests THEN it SHALL include tests for browser-specific APIs like notifications, clipboard, and device orientation
3. WHEN new JavaScript APIs need testing THEN the system SHALL allow easy addition of new test pages
